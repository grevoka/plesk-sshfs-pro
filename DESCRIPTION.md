## What is SSHFS PRO?

SSHFS Pro is a software that allows you to mount a remote server as if it were a local disk on your computer. It uses the Linux FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) module and the SSH protocol to establish a secure connection with the remote server and provide transparent access to the files on that server.

SSHFS Pro also allows you to mount remote servers that use other network protocols such as FTP and WebDAV, providing you with great flexibility in accessing your remote files.

With SSHFS Pro, you can easily navigate through the files on the remote server as if it were a local disk, with the ability to read, write, and modify these files as needed. You can also use all the local applications on your computer to work with the files on the remote server, without having to use a separate FTP or WebDAV client.

Using SSHFS Pro, you can easily access your remote files and work with them as if they were stored on your local computer, which can be very convenient if you frequently work with remote files or need quick access to your files on a remote server.
